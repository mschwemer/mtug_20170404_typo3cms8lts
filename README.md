## TYPO3 Theme

For this presentation I forked the reveal.js repository to create a theme for TYPO3,
which anybody can use and contribute to.

As the time of writing, it is just a basic version (and I am no css and design wizard ^^). 
So feel free to contribute. I am really happy about contributions.

The repository for the theme resides in the branch:

https://github.com/mschwemer/reveal.js/tree/feature/theme-typo3

The process to update css / content and to check it, is the very same as with the "native"
reveal.js using grunt.
