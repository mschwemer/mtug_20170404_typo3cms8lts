## TYPO3 Theme

For this presentation I forked the reveal.js repository to create a theme for TYPO3,
which anybody can use and contribute to.

As the time of writing, it is just a basic version (and I am no css and design wizard ^^). 
So feel free to contribute. I am really happy about contributions.

The repository for the theme resides in the branch:
